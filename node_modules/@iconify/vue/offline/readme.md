# @iconify/vue/offline

This sub-directory contains `package.json` with entry points for importing `@iconify/vue/offline`.

There is a duplicate entry in `exports` section of `package.json` in the parent directory, but at moment of coding this, TypeScript does not support conditional exports properly, so this directory is used as a duplicate to make everything work with TypeScript.
